## Abstract
This project presents a machine learning-based approach for detecting and identifying plant diseases from images of affected plants. Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques, we develop an accurate and efficient disease detection system. Our results demonstrate the potential of computer vision and deep learning algorithms in enabling early disease detection, reducing crop losses, and improving food security.
